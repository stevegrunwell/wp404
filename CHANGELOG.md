## [Unreleased]

### Added

* A new reporter, `wp_query`, that tracks the contents of the `$wp_query` variable.
* An .editorconfig file to the root of the repository (for development purposes).

### Changed

* The `post_exists` reporter will now return a string ("No matching post data was found.") rather than an empty array if we're unable to parse any post data.
